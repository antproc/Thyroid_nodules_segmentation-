# Thyroid nodule segmentation in ultrasound images using UNet with Resnet encoder

This code accompanies a research paper titled "Thyroid nodule segmentation in ultrasound images using UNet with Resnet encoder: best performance on public data" 

Due to the large size of the datasets used in the study, they could not be included in the GitHub repository. However, interested parties can access and download the datasets from the following external sources:

TDID dataset:
URL: http://cimalab.unal.edu.co/applications/thyroid/

TN3K dataset:
URL: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1reHyY5eTZ5uePXMVMzFOq5j3eFOSp50F/view

Thyroid Digital Image Database (TDID) dataset:
URL: https://stanfordaimi.azurewebsites.net/datasets/a72f2b02-7b53-4c5d-963c-d7253220bfd5

Implementation and evaluation of the proposed UNet with Resnet encoder, can be found in the file "Thyroid_nodules_segmentation_ResUNet.ipynb."

The jupyter notebook contains the results and predicted masks of the best model, which is a combination of the TN3K and TDID datasets, along with one randomly selected image (n=1) from the Thyroid Ultrasound Cine-clip dataset. Due to its size, the model itself cannot be uploaded directly to GitHub.

Sincerely,
Authors
